    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With the return of theatrical movie releases, in addition to the increase in streaming video content, Microsoft has expressed interest in creating their own movie studio. To maximize their chances of success, they have requested an analysis of the best performing movies at the box office. This analysis explored the factors that tend to make a movie commercially and critically successful. The relationship between box office results and genre, awards votes, and release dates were analyzed to determine what combinations were most likely to produce popular and profitable movies. The analysis found that action-adventure and science fiction movies were big hits with both critics and audiences. Additionally, animated family movies were highly profitable relative to their production costs and the best time to release a movie in any genre is early summer or around Thanksgiving and Christmas."

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a movie studio is a big undertaking and therefore requires a good amount of forethought. Our statistical analysis of variable will assist Microsoft in determining the direction of their studio. Like any business, the studio must make money to remain operational so the box office results were focused on from the beginning. Profitability, genre, seasonality and run times were the main focuses of the analysis and were deemed to be vital to the success of a movie and the studio itself. What makes a high grossing movie? The team analyzed the gross profits compared to movie genres that most people took interest in as well as seasonality to determine the best release time. We also analyzed run times of movies to determine whether the length of a movie would affect a movie's likability. By determining the factors most correlated with box office success, Microsoft's new studio can use the results to produce movies with confidence that they'll be profitable and well received."

    "\n",
    "The data used in this analysis was taken from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/), and [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), websites that track multiple metrics related to movies and allow users to review and discuss these movies. The data files provided release dates, genre information, awards vote numbers, run time, production budgets as well as domestic and worldwide gross figures for thousands of movies. The target variables were the profits which laid a foundation for the rest of the analysis which dove deeper into their respective genres and release dates. The dataset primarily contains quantitative numerical data, with the instance of qualitative categorical data of genres. By representing profit, award vote counts, and release years and months as numbers, statistical analysis and conditional filtering could be performed."

In doing so, we accumulated columns that contained duplicate or unnecessary data to our analysis and those columns were dropped. Data such as the numeric genre codes were changed to the respective genre titles that correlated to The Movie Database's database. Lastly, columns for Profit and Profit:Gross Ratio were calculated to be used in the visualizations.\n",

Identifying trends in the movies that remain in the data set allowed us to base our recommendations on the most well received movies."

    "    * The audience range for animated movies spans across the largest age range.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Recommendation 2: Released the movie in the Summer or right before the Holidays in November\n",
    "    * Movies released around these seasons profited the most. This can be attributed to the larger amount of freetime people have during these time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recommendation 3: Do not be overly concerned with movie Run Time\n",
    "    * There is no strong correlation with awards, profit, or ROI when comparing short vs. long run times.\n",

    "* Missing data\n",
    "* Dataset contains incorrect information, such as two movies having the same name. The release date would correlate with one movie, but the genre would correlate with the secondary movie.\n",

    "Next Steps:\n",
    "* Look into Streaming vs. Box office performance for genres\n",
